# Rubik's Cube
A few years back for my soon to be born daughter I wrote a [Rubik's Cube](https://rubikscube.codeplex.com/) on Microsoft WPF/Silverlight platform.

This is a 3D Rubik's Cube written in Javascript. It also supports rotation on unfolded state (which was not supported on original silverlight version). 
You can unfold (with O command) the cube and rotate it to help build intuitions of cubie permutation more easily.

* [three js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js/)
* [tween js](https://github.com/tweenjs/tween.js/)
